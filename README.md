LGT Tracker
-----------
This is a fork from the Legit library, in an attempt to decouple it's internal LGT vision tracker.

*Description from legit:*

LGT - a C++ port of the LGT tracker as described in TPAMI paper "Robust Visual Tracking using an Adaptive Coupled-layer Visual Model". More details available [here](http://www.vicos.si/Research/LocalGlobalTracking). The code is in some sections different from the official Matlab implementation so the results may be different.
